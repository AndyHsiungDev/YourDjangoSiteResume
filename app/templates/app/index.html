<h1>DjangoCon 2015 Microsoft deployment challenge!</h1>

<img src="/static/app/images/azure_code_challenge_small.png" id="azure_challenge_badge" />

<h2>Deploy your Django web apps on Azure</h2>
<p>Did you know Python applications can be hosted on Microsoft Azure, too? Yes, that means your Django apps (and Flask, Bottle, and more!). Microsoft Azure is about much more than just Windows and .NET.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure offers a wide array of creation, deployment and management capabilities through the Azure Management Portal, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/">x-plat CLI</a> (cross-platform, command-line interface), or PowerShell cmdlets.</p>


<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clone this GitHub repo.</li>
    <li>Run the app locally to confirm its working.</li>
    <li>Modify with your own information.</li>
    <li>Deploy the web app to Azure</li>
    <li>That's it! You've completed the challenge. Stop by the Microsoft booth to get you custom, limited-run t-shirt!</li>
</ul>

<div class="note_box">
    <h5>TL;DR</h5>
    <p>You could just skip all of these steps by forking the GitHub repo and deploying the app using the "easy" button. We get it. You're busy eating breakfast tacos, making new Django friends, and catching up with old ones. We won't hold it against you and you still get a t-shirt.</p>
    <p>But that's not much of a challenge, now is it?</p>
</div>



<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To complete this challenge you'll need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure account</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Sign up for a free trial, or <strong>get a free $100 Azure pass from the Microsoft booth</strong>. (If you want to get started before signing up, go to <a href="https://tryappservice.azure.com/">Try App Service</a>, where you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app. No credit card required; no commitments.)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Windows, Mac or Linux</li>
    <li>
        A code editor
        <ul>
            <li>Want to give <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> a try? It's free and cross-platform.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Python 2.7 or 3.4</li>
    <li>setuptools, pip, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> (Python 2.7 only)</li>
    <li>Git and/or a GitHub account</li>
    <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=517189&clcid=0x409" target="_blank">Python Tools 2.1 for Visual Studio</a> - This is optional, but a great tool for Windows developers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>These steps describe how to get started running Python on Azure Web Apps.</p>
<p>This is DjangoCon, so we'll be using the Django web framework, of course. You will create a web app from the Azure Marketplace, set up deployment via local Git or GitHub. Then you will run the application locally, make changes, commit and push them to Azure. We'll show how to do this from Windows or Mac/Linux. </p>

<h3>Create a Web App in Azure</h3>

<p>The first step in creating your app is to create a web app via the Azure Portal. Azure Web Apps support Python, .NET, Java, PHP, and Node.js. </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Log into the Azure Portal and click the NEW button in the top left corner. Click Web + Mobile > Azure Marketplace > Web Apps.
        <br />
        <img src="/static/app/images/create1.PNG" alt="Click Web + Mobile > Azure Marketplace > Web Apps" class="wide_screenshot">
    </li>
    <li>
        Configure the new Django app, such as creating a new App Service plan and a new resource group for it. Your app name will be your sub-domain and will need to be unique. Then, click Create.
        <br />
        <img src="/static/app/images/create2.png" alt="Click Web + Mobile > Azure Marketplace > Web Apps" class="narrow_screenshot">
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You now have an empty web app running on Azure. Let's put something in it!</p>

<h3>Clone the DjangoCon Challenge repo and run locally</h3>
<p>Our goal here is to create a very simple website. You have a few options here, but the simplest one is to simply clone the GitHub repo:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/atxryan/DjangoCon
cd https://github.com/atxryan/DjangoCon </code></pre>

<h3>Let's take a look at the app structure</h3>

<pre><code>- app
    - static/app
    - templates/app
        - index.html
        - layout.html
- djangocon
    - __init__.py
    - local_settings.py.SAMPLE
    - settings.py
    - urls.py
    - wsgi.py
- .gitignore
- db.sqlite3
- manage.py
- <b>ptvs_virtualenv_proxy.py</b>
- readme.md
- <b>requirements.txt</b>
- <b>web.2.7.config</b>
- <b>web.3.4.config</b>
- web.debug.config</code>
</pre>
<p>It's a very basic Django app, with a few files you may not recognize. The following files are needed to deploy your Django application to Azure.</p>
<p><strong>requirements.txt</strong> - External packages needed by this application. The deployment script will pip install the packages listed in this file.</p>
<p><strong>ptvs_virtualenv_proxy.py</strong> - IIS proxy for virtual environments and PTVS remote debugging support.</p>
<p><strong>Web.2.7.config</strong> and <strong>web.3.4.config</strong> - These are IIS configuration files used by Azure. The deployment script will use the appropriate web.x.y.config and copy it as web.config.</p>


<h3>Create virtual environment</h3>
<p>Now that you've got the code on your local machine, let's setup a virtual environment and run the local development server. Choose instructions below to set up via the command line (Windows, Mac, or Linux) or in Visual Studio (Windows).</p>

<h4 class="instructions_header" data-for-block="env-command-line"> &#8702; Command Line instructions<span>(click to expand)</span></h4>
<div class="instructions" data-instruction-block="env-command-line">
    <p>We'll create a new virtual environment for development purposes (do not add it to the repository). Virtual environments in Python are not relocatable, so every developer working on the application will create their own locally.</p>

    For Python 2.7:
<pre><code>python -m virtualenv env</code></pre>
    For Python 3.4:
<pre><code>python -m venv env</code></pre>
    Install the external packages required by your application. In our case, the only requirement is Django. You can use the requirements.txt file at the root of the repository to install the packages in your virtual environment:
<pre><code>env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

<p>You can launch the application under a local development server with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>env\scripts\python manage.py runserver</code></pre>
